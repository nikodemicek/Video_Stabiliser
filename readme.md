Hey!

Not planning to pay for video stabilising apps and they are free only with an annoying watermark.

This simple notebook can handle simple digital video stabilization until I get a fancier lens
(damn, they're expensive) or my hands stop shaking (can't count on that). But shaky videos for
my insta reels are super annoying. This tool helps at least a bit.

Feel free to suggest any improvements, this is just a quick (but quite useful) side project.


Guide:
1. Drop your video files in the 'original' folder (or change the path to whatever you like)
2. Run the code
3. Check the stable videos in the 'stabilized' folder
4. If unhappy, try different kp_methods or other parameters - refer to VidStab documentation: https://pypi.org/project/vidstab/
